                                   COMPUTER BASED EXAMINATION
                                   ***************************
   We have created a MCQ  exam using PHP,Mysql,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap & JAVAScript.
   
   To run php pages one needs to install lampp on linux or mac and xampp on windows.
   
   The questions along with answers are stored in database created through my MySql
   
   and is then operated through myPhpAdmin.
   
   Basic webpage is created in html,cascading is done in CSS,fuctions are executed by 
   JAVAScript.
   
   Questions/Answers/Userdata can be altered by admin by accesing database.
   
  For now the program doesn't has a timer to measure the time taken by a student for 
  giving a test.
